            <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
            <em>
                [Add: a rationale for your design decisions.
                How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques?
                What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?]

                Eric:
                We discussed various data sets.
                Iris and titantic were initial contenders.
                Decided on olympic and map tutorial since there was more flexibility.
                From there we decided on vertical bar graphs of medals each country had taken.
                Which morphed into horizontal stacked bar graph of medals.
                Didn't use map if favor of simple checklist to leave enough time to get graph right.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>

                [Add: describe how the work was split among the team members.
                Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
                Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? 
                What aspects took the most time?]

                Eric started by getting a discord group, github repo, and trello setup and shared.
                We met to discuss data sets and graph representations.
                Decided on olympic 2021 data shown as selectable world map and graphs of medals taken.
                Eric used selectable dummy data in a checklist to display a vertical bar graph.
                It took some time since it was Eric's first time with d3. 
                Eric replaced the dummy data with olympic medals data. 
                This was difficult because Eric couldn't get the xlsx data imported into js.
                Eric's solution was to convert xlsx to json and copy/paste the data directly into graph js.
                We received our assigned github repo and Eric ported the existing repo to this new repo. 
                We decided not to use multiple graphs and instead use a stacked bar chart.
                We engaged in group programming and implemented a vertical stacked bar chart from a tutorial.
                Shortly after we switched again to using a horizontal bar chart. 
                We then had olympic data shown on the horizontal bar graph, a legend, and a checklist but no interactivity.
                Eric removed the embedded json imported the data instead. 
                Eric broke the code into functions for dynamically updating the graph to match the selection.
                Eric got the checklist selections to update the graph.
                The difficulty was getting the imported data out of jquery and into js.
                Eric did code cleanup.
                Consistent variable names, delete unused code, tool tip reformat, graph position, margins, scale, and colors.
                We had a bug with dyamically scaling the x axis when USA, and USA only, was selected.
                Eric fixed it by adding a short circuit when USA was selected. Ugly but functional.
                Eric added select and deselect all buttons.
                Eric's biggest challenges/contributions: Initial basic graph, import json, checklist to graph interactivity, max bug, and select/deselect buttons.
                Eric's total time estimate: 20+ hours.

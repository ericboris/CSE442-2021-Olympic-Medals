                Eric: We decided to use olympic 2021 data with the expectation of showing a selectable world
                map which when selected showed multiple bar graphs of how many medals the selected countries
                had taken in the 2021 olympics. 
                I began by trying to show a basic vertical bar graph of dummy data. 
                That took some effort since this was my first time using D3. 
                Then I connected the medals data with this graph. 
                At that time we were showing only a subset of the olympic data on this basic graph.
                We decided not to use multiple graphs and instead use a stacked bar chart.
                We engaged in group programming to implement a vertical stacked bar chart from a tutorial.
                Shortly after we switched to using a horizontal bar chart. 
                With that in place we had a scrolling selection bar of countries that could be selected/deselected,
                a legend, and a stacked horiontal bar chart. 
                I first worked to remove the embedded JSON data from the file, it took up over 800 lines and 
                made working in the file cumbersome. 
                This took a surprising amount of time.
                Similarly I removed code we weren't using from Legend function.  
                Then I worked on minor parts, variable name clean up, naming consistency, 
                tool tip reformatting, adjusting graph positioning, margins, scale, and colors. 
                One peculiar bug we encountered is worth noting. 
                We were dynamically scaling the graph x axis to match the maximimum bar length. 
                However, when USA was selected the graph was scaling to the second largest bar length.
                I couldn't solve the bug directly and added short circuit code instead. 
                I added select and deselect all buttons for ease of use and a few smaller margin/positioning updates. 
                All told, my biggest contributions were getting an initial graph connected to the data and index.html,
                get initial select/deselct working,
                removing the JSON from the file took longer than it should have, breaking key features into functions
                so that we could hide/show selections, connect the list selection to actually hide show, fix the max
                bug, and add select and deselect buttons.
                I estimate that I've spend ~20+ hours on this assignment.

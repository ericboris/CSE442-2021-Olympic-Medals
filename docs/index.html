            <em>
                [Add: a rationale for your design decisions.
                How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques?

                Eric:
                <br>
                We discussed various data sets.
                Iris and titantic were initial contenders.
                Decided on olympic and map tutorial since there was more flexibility.
                From there we decided on vertical bar graphs of medals each country had taken.
                Which morphed into horizontal stacked bar graph of medals.
                Didn't use map if favor of simple checklist to leave enough time to get graph right.
                <br>
                <br>
                Alyssa:
                <br>
                Because we decided to use 2021 Olympic medal data, we initially decided that we wanted a
                world map to represent the different countries in the data set. We would then have four
                (yes, four!) graphs to the right side of the map that would show the number of gold, silver,
                bronze, and total medals for the countries chosen from the map. In the process of getting
                one working graph functioning like we wanted it to, we quickly realized we needed to adjust our design.
                We chose to have the countries listed in a a scroll box and they can be selected for comparison
                by checking the box next to the country. We also decided that 4 graphs was overkill, and we could
                properly compare the data using a horizontal stacked graph. We chose a stacked graph because
                it uses size and color to properly convey to the reader how the countries shaped up against each other
                last summer. The color scheme for us was fairly obvious. Gold had to be gold, and so on. 
                Luckily, those colors are fairly easy to make out on their own, but we added a legend to make it
                crystal clear. There is also a tooltip that displays how many medals were earned for whichever section
                the mouse is hovering. Our y-axis displays our dimension, which are the countries being compared to each other.
                This is a nominal data type. Our x-axis is the measure and it's the total number of medals earned, a 
                quantitative ratio data type. We also have a z-axis! The stacked bars are split up by gold, silver, and bronze
                medals, which are ordinal. We chose our interaction technique because we wanted the reader to be able to compare
                whichever countries they want, no matter how many or how few. The bars dynamically change size to fit the new
                data into the graph, and the countries are easy to scroll through to make comparison choices.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>

                [Add: describe how the work was split among the team members.
                Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
                Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? 
                What aspects took the most time?]
            </em>
            <div>
                Eric started by getting a discord group, github repo, and trello setup and shared.
                We met to discuss data sets and graph representations.
                Decided on olympic 2021 data shown as selectable world map and graphs of medals taken.
                Eric used selectable dummy data in a checklist to display a vertical bar graph.
                It took some time since it was Eric's first time with d3. 
                Eric replaced the dummy data with olympic medals data. 
                This was difficult because Eric couldn't get the xlsx data imported into js.
                Eric's solution was to convert xlsx to json and copy/paste the data directly into graph js.
                We received our assigned github repo and Eric ported the existing repo to this new repo. 
                We decided not to use multiple graphs and instead use a stacked bar chart.
                We engaged in group programming and implemented a vertical stacked bar chart from a tutorial.
                Shortly after we switched again to using a horizontal bar chart. 
                We then had olympic data shown on the horizontal bar graph, a legend, and a checklist but no interactivity.
                Eric removed the embedded json imported the data instead. 
                Eric broke the code into functions for dynamically updating the graph to match the selection.
                Eric got the checklist selections to update the graph.
                The difficulty was getting the imported data out of jquery and into js.
                Eric did code cleanup.
                Consistent variable names, delete unused code, tool tip reformat, graph position, margins, scale, and colors.
                We had a bug with dyamically scaling the x axis when USA, and USA only, was selected.
                Eric fixed it by adding a short circuit when USA was selected. Ugly but functional.
                Eric added select and deselect all buttons.
                Eric's biggest challenges/contributions: Initial basic graph, import json, checklist to graph interactivity, max bug, and select/deselect buttons.
                Eric's total time estimate: 20+ hours.

                Alyssa worked on the initial graph by adding axes and adjusting them to fit the needs of the graph.
                Alyssa wrapped the large country list into a scrollbox.
                Alyssa began creating a second "gold" graph to be shown side by side with the first graph.
                Alyssa tried really damn hard to implement the stacked graph and legend by herself.
                Alyssa and team programmed together to successfully implement stacked bar graph and legend.
                Alyssa and An found where to put the render calls, how to initialize a blank graph, and how to clear the graph.
                Alyssa wrote a method to dynamically change the size of the x axis depending on which countries were selected.

                Alyssa's biggest challenges: Scrapped gold graph, dynamic x axis bugs,
			                                unsuccessfully implementing the stacked graph, JS in general.
                Alyssa's total time estimate: ~14 hours
